# EmuSC
Emulating the Sound Canvas

## About
EmuSC is a software synthesizer that aims to emulate the Roland Sound Canvas SC-55 lineup to recreate the original sounds of these '90s era synthesizers. 

EmuSC is currently in an early development stage and is not able to reproduce sounds anywhere near the quality of the original synths, but the goal is to be able to reproduce sounds that will make it difficult to notice the difference. If you are interested in emulating the SC-55 today your best bet is to try the [SC-55 sound font](https://github.com/Kitrinx/SC55_Soundfont) made by Kitrinx and NewRisingSun.

The project is split in two parts:
* [libEmuSC](./libemusc/README.md): A library that implements all the Sound Canvas emulation.
* [EmuSC](./emusc/README.md): A desktop application that serves as a frontend to libEmuSC.

This project is in no way endorsed by or affiliated with Roland Corp.
